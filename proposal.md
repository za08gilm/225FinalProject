Whack-a-mole: This game will generate a board with 5 black ovals, each of which will be a hole in which a mole object can randomly 
appear out of, each one being controlled using a thread. This program will use only one mouse event handler, mouse clicked; if the mouse 
is clicked over one of the mole objects while it is on screen, a new image of the mole will be drawn, showing it has been whacked, and will 
go back in its hole, and the player’s score will increase. If the player does not click on the mole in time, it will begin to go back in 
it’s hole. The player will also be able to adjust the amount of time they can play using a JSpinner and choose how fast the moles are using 
a JComboBox. Major milestones will be getting the frame code done, getting the moles to be active, getting the game to basic functionality, and adding additional features so that is more than basic.
