Whack-a-mole: This game will generate a board with 5 black ovals, each of which will be a hole in which a mole object can randomly 
appear out of, each one being controlled using a thread. This program will use only one mouse event handler, mouse clicked; if the mouse 
is clicked over one of the mole objects while it is on screen, a new image of the mole will be drawn, showing it has been whacked, and will 
go back in its hole, and the player’s score will increase. If the player does not click on the mole in time, it will begin to go back in 
it’s hole. The player will also be able to adjust the amount of time they can play using a JSpinner and choose how fast the moles are using 
a JComboBox. Major milestones will be getting the frame code done (20), getting the moles to be active(40), getting the game to basic functionality(50), and adding additional features so that is more than basic(40). We plan on having sounds for when a mole is hit and missed. Also plan on changing the mole image when hit or missed.
One of the most important milestone is the mouse events. We have to make sure that the moles do what we want and not be hit when a mole next to them is hit or when they are not above ground. 

Piano: This program will be a piano simulator. The piano's image will change when pressed a key is pressed and it will play a sound file. This will be done using key listeners. In order to save screen space we'll paint one octave at a time. Each time a key is pressed the octave and sound will change. A JComboBox will be used for this. Major mile stones for this project will be using sound files, multiple images, and switching to the correct image and sound when a key is pressed. The most important part is the getting the key listeners right because without it nothing will work. 



Schedule: April17-19 during the weekend we're going to get into a call and layout the projects and try to find a good approach.
          AFTER that weekend we're going to actually start coding Whack-A-Mole and hopefully finish it within that week and begin Piano.
           After that week we'll finish up the piano game or at least make it presentable for May 1st.
